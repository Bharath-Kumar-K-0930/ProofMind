# Project Rules: ProofMind-AI

## Code Style
- Use ES6 modules (prefer `require` for Backend if consistency dictates, but `import/export` for Frontend).
- File names: `kebab-case` for utils/configs, `camelCase` for services, `PascalCase` for React components.
- API routes: `/api/v1/resource` style (prefixed with `/api`).

## Security Conventions
- Always validate input on Backend routes.
- Use `dotenv` for all secrets. Never hardcode keys.
- Implement rate limiting for AI generation routes.
- Sanitize data before canonicalization.

## 0G Network Integration
- Reference: https://docs.0g.ai/ai-context
- Use `@0gfoundation/0g-cc` for proof storage and verification.

## Development Workflow
- **Plan First**: Every phase must have a section in `plan.md`.
- **Commit Often**: Commit after every phase completion.
- **Log Everything**: Update `PROJECT_LOG.md` after every phase.
- **Explain It**: Always provide a "Junior Dev" explanation after code generation.
